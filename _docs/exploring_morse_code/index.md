This is the first of the main HIDIOT projects that we're including as part of our tutorial series. Now that you've built and programmed your HIDIOT, we're going to teach you how to do things with it.

The format of these projects is less formal than the tutorials, focusing more on doing cool things with rather than to the HIDIOT.

None of these projects require extra hardware. Having said that there are tons of things you can do with extra hardware, which you should definitely explore once you've finished these projects.

Ultimately it's your HIDIOT and nobody can tell you what you can and can't do with it, although we would ask that you stay safe at all times doing so.

In our first project we're going to learn Morse code. We'll decode secret government messages embedded in pop music, then we're going to follow the actual last messages from the deadly maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic. Along the way we'll write some code so the HIDIOT can talk to us using Morse code, and we'll learn a bit about arrays, memory storage, strings and structures.

This project is split into 3 parts:

* [Understanding Morse code](/exploring_morse_code/understanding_morse_code/) *(20-35 minutes including video)*
* [A watery grave: The last messages from the RMS Titanic](/exploring_morse_code/a_watery_grave/) *(15-20 minutes plus optional activities)*
* [Making the HIDIOT send any Morse code message](/exploring_morse_code/morse_messenger_upgrades/) *(15 minutes)*
