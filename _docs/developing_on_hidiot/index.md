This is the last of the getting started tutorials. Once you've completed this, you'll have developed all the necessary foundation knowledge you need in order to build your own hardware and program it. From the next tutorial on, everything we're going to do is simply building on top of that knowledge base.

Along the way we're going to learn about techniques that we'll use across the rest of the tutorials. There's puzzles to solve and you'll be on your way to making your own HIDIOT projects in no time.

But back to this tutorial. This tutorial is a little bit different. It's split into 2 tutorial parts, and 3 optional projects. The tutorial parts take you through a very simple sketch, and introduce some core programming concepts.

Before you move on to the main projects, you should try the 3 small projects. Each introduces a new programming concept. You can jump straight to the main projects after completing the first 3 sections, but you'll get more out of your HIDIOT if you at least try the small projects first.

This tutorial is split into 2 parts:

* [Understanding Sketches](/developing_on_hidiot/understanding_sketches/) *(20-35 minutes including a break)*
* [How the HIDIOT handles values](/developing_on_hidiot/how_the_hidiot_handles_values/) *(15 minutes)*

Once the tutorials are complete, there are 3 mini projects to try:

* [Blinking pretty patterns](/developing_on_hidiot/blinking_pretty_patterns/) *(15-30 minutes)*
* [Blinking a warning](/developing_on_hidiot/warning_blinks/) *(15-30 minutes)*
* [Blinking codes](/developing_on_hidiot/blinking_codes/) *(15-30 minutes)*
