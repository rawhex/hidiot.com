Now you have a fully built HIDIOT in your hands, (or on your desk, or ... somewhere nearby) you're ready to program the thing. In the old days, when computers as powerful as the HIDIOT took up whole rooms and most of us used to have computers less powerful than a watch, we'd just plug the computer into a TV, switch it on and start typing to program it.

Because the HIDIOT is a gateway to professional embedded development (or in other words, doing cool hardware hacking) we're going to use professional tools for our projects.

Currently we only support Windows 10 for development. The HIDIOT will work on other Operating Systems and platforms, and you can even develop on it. It's just that we don't have the capacity to support every possible platform for now. If you want to use the HIDIOT in a particular way and can't, tell [the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/hidiot/) and we'll see what we can do.

This tutorial is split into 2 parts:

* [Setting up your HIDIOT](/cutting_code/setting_up_your_hidiot/) *(20-35 minutes including video)*
* [Using the Arduino IDE](/cutting_code/using_the_arduino_ide/) *(10-15 minutes plus optional follow-on activities)*
