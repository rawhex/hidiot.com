Welcome to the wonderful world of the HIDIOT. The HIDIOT is a computer that you build yourself from scratch. It allows you to explore the worlds of electronics, programming, microcontrollers, robots, the Internet and even radio, which is a lot for something so small!

By the time you finish these tutorials you'll be a fully fledged hardware hacker and maker, ready to build amazing projects of your own! These tutorials are designed to teach you how to build, program and get to grips with the HIDIOT so you can then create your own projects to do all kinds of fun things. From electric jewellery to monitoring the International Space Station, if you can imagine it, you can probably do it with a HIDIOT.

This tutorial is split into 3 parts:
