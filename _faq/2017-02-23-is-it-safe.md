The HIDIOT has been tested across a variety of platforms and a wide range of different hardware devices. When correctly built, it’s never caused a problem.

Having said that, you’re able to operate at a level much lower than you may be used to, and as always with hardware there are no 100% guarantees that you won’t fry something.

We can’t accept responsibility for your own soldering and programming, but if you take basic precautions, build it properly and don’t do things that will obviously cause sparks to fly, you should be fine. If in doubt, check in with our community before trying.
