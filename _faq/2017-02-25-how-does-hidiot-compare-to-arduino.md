The HIDIOT is very similar to an Arduino, but is designed to be built by you. The biggest differences are in the memory and the available GPIO pins (the HIDIOT has less memory and fewer pins, but assembling 28 pin chips by hand is no fun for anyone!).

The other major difference is that because you build the HIDIOT, when you use the HIDIOT for mobile projects, you only need to solder together what you need. That means no power draining LEDs if you're not going to use them.

Ultimately, if you have a project in mind then you should pick the right tool for the job. If you want to learn how to build smaller projects in a structured manner, the HIDIOT is probably the right tool.
