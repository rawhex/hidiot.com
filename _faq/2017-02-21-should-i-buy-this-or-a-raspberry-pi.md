Really you should try both.

The Raspberry Pi is a great range of computers, and the HIDIOT plays well with the Pi (especially over USB). However, the Raspberry Pi comes as a complete package. You can’t build your own Raspberry Pi, and the Raspberry Pi runs code that you can’t control in order to boot. That’s not to say it’s a bad thing, it’s just different. With the HIDIOT, you’ll be able to understand every single component on the board, swap them out and do what you like.

We have 20 tutorials that make no assumptions about prior knowledge, and are designed to be a maximum of an hour long for busy people to fit them in.

Because the HIDIOT is designed to be hacked on, you can modify your HIDIOT any way you like. Want more than two LEDs? Go ahead. Want no LEDs? Go ahead. Want extra push-buttons? Go ahead. Want to rebuild your own HIDIOT from scratch on a breadboard? You can do that too!

For more detail on what separates the HIDIOT from others, check out our blog post.
