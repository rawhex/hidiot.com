Our original HIDIOT prototype used for the 44CON badge was a massive hit at the event. Over 100 badges were assembled over a two day period, and we could’ve gone on for longer! Many thanks to Tomasz Miklas for running the table, and to everyone involved in making the HIDIOT badge happen!

There’s a guide to getting started with your 44CON badge edition of HIDIOT on the 44CON blog. Once we have the final prototypes built, we’ll start documenting setup here.
