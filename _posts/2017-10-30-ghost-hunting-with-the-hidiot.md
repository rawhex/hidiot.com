You may have seen ghost hunters on TV, investigating paranormal activity (or like us, you may have heard it from hiding behind the sofa while the programme's been on). Did you know that you can use your HIDIOT to build the same type of equipment that ghost hunters use to track down bumps in the night? This battery powered halloween project is easy to build within 30 minutes, and is great for kids and adults.
