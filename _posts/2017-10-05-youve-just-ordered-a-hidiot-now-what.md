Firstly, thanks for ordering your HIDIOT! If you've never soldered or coded anything before, you're on your way to a whole new world of electronics and programming. We've slaved away on documentation, tutorials, all kinds of stuff to help you get the most from your purchase, and this blog is here to show you what to do next. Bookmark this post now, give it a read through then come back at the weekend.
