The HIDIOT will be launched at Hack In The Box Amsterdam. Come see us at the HITB CommSec Village where you can buy and build your own HIDIOT, or come to Steve’s HITB Lab at 2pm for 2 hours of Unbridled HIDIOcy!

Access to the CommSec Village and the CommSec track are free. There’s a host of great talks going on, and there’ll be plenty of hacking opportunities. We’re really excited to launch at the netherland’s biggest hacking event!

At our table, we’ll have HIDIOTs available to buy (subject to availability) and soldering stations for people to use. Sit down with Steve, Aidan or Marizel and we’ll help you build yours, even if you’ve never soldered before. We’ll help you get started with the Arduino IDE, and help you get a head start on our tutorials.

On the 13th, Steve will be running a 2 hour workshop in the HITB Lab on the CommSec track. Access to the workshop is also free. Bring your HIDIOTs to the lab, and Steve will show you how to do some amazing things from a long overdue Raspberry Pi physical shutdown key to exploiting Windows systems and random number generation.

Hack In The Box Amsterdam takes place at the NH Grand Krasnapolsky, Dam 9, Amsterdam, 1012 JS, Netherlands. With training from the start of the week, we’ll be there on the 13th and 14th of April. Hope to see you there!
