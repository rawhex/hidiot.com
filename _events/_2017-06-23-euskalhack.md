We’re really looking forward to coming to Euskalhack. Steve and Marizel will be there with HIDIOTs for you to play with. Steve will be talking about the HIDIOT, it’s design and it’s potential for interesting uses (and abuses). He’ll also talk about the importance of open hardware design, and the right to void your warranty.

Marizel and Steve will be happy to chat and walk you through building a HIDIOT and getting started with tutorials. We’ll have a few HIDIOTs with us, and no doubt we’ll find a way to build them while we’re there.

The Euskalhack Security Congress will take place on the 23rd and 24th of June at Colegio Mayor Olarain in Donostia.
