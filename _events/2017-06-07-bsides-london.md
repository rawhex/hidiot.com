Steve, Marizel and Aidan will be at BSides London on the 44CON table along with Emma from 44CON. As well as being able to buy 44CON tickets, we’ll have HIDIOTs available and will be happy to answer questions and show you what you can do with one.

We’re submitting talks and workshops to BSides London. If we get enough support during the voting period, we’ll run workshops and talks to help you get the most out of the HIDIOT. We’re expecting to release a new project tutorial specifically for BSides London, so don’t forget to vote for us!

BSides London takes place on the 7th of June at the ILEC, Lillie Road, London. The nearest tube is West Brompton. Tickets are free but hard to get hold of, so don’t forget to keep an eye on the BSides London website and reserve your ticket quick!
