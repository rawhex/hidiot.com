Security Fest is a great event in Gothenburg, we'll be there with 200 special Security Fest Edition HIDIOTs for attendees, and will be running workshops over the course of the day to help you get the most from your HIDIOT.

Steve will also give a keynote talk about IoT Security.

Marizel and Steve will be happy to chat and walk you through building a HIDIOT and getting started with tutorials. We'll have a few extra on standby in case anyone wants some more to take home.

Security Fest will take place on June 1st, at Eriksbergshallen, Gothenburg. Tickets are available [here](https://securityfest.com/buy/).
