title: Welcome to the HIDIOT documentation!

> Please note: This site is a work in progress. Tutorials are being added weekly. If you have a prototype, please check back for updates.

This is the documentation for the [HIDIOT](https://hidiot.com).

On this site you'll find 10 tutorials designed to help you get up and running. Our tutorials are projects that cover different aspects of the HIDIOT, from hardware and electricity to software.

All of these tutorials are designed for two people to follow together, but some of these will require adult supervision.

Most tutorials are split into 3 parts, each part should take roughly 15 minutes, and allow for a 5 minute break.

The code samples used in this tutorial are available on our [Github](https://github.com/rawhex/hidiot-tutorials). Details on how to install the code can be found in [Tutorial 3](/cutting_code/index/).
