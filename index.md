title: Welcome to the HIDIOT documentation!
---

> Please note: This site is a work in progress. Tutorials are being added regularly.

This is the documentation for the [HIDIOT](https://hidiot.com). If you'd like to use this material elsewhere, please [read our licensing](/using_this_documentation/index/) information first.

On this site you'll find tutorials designed to help you get up and running. Our tutorials are projects that cover different aspects of the HIDIOT, from hardware and electricity to software.

All of these tutorials are designed for two people to follow together, but some of these will require adult supervision.

Most tutorials are split into 3 parts, each part should take roughly 15 minutes, and allow for a 5 minute break.

The code samples used in this tutorial are available on our [Github](https://github.com/rawhex/hidiot-tutorials). Details on how to install the code can be found in [Tutorial 3](/cutting_code/index/).

### Other Resources

There are a lot of resources online to help you get the most from your HIDIOT. Here's just a few:

* [Our Community Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hidiot), where you can ask support questions
